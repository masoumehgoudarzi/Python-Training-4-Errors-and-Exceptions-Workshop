It covers the difference between syntax errors and runtime exceptions, explains common exception types, and demonstrates how to use try, except, else, and finally blocks to write more robust programs. By completing this workshop, users will learn how to identify, handle, and debug errors effectively, reducing program crashes and improving user experience. This is part of the Python Basics Workshop Series provided to help learners strengthen their Python programming skills.
